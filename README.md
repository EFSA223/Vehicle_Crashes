# Playing with Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS

For the second part of Module 05 and the final assignment for Map675, I choose for option 2.

**Option 2**: Follow one of the intermediate or advanced Mapbox Tutorials. You may want to quickly run through the tutorial using their data/example first and then do it with your own data. Be sure it's one of the tutorials tagged with `</> JavaScript` and NOT beginner `</> No code`.

I choose to build a map apllication with Mapbox GL JS (Tag: Advanced </>Javascript), [Show changes over time with Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/show-changes-over-time/).
